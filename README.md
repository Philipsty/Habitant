# Habitant
Habitat is an application developed to give the user an accurate and quantitative measure of quality of life in a location. 
The main benefactors of such an application would be current citizens of Canada, immigrants and also real estate companies. 
This solution is produced by an algorithm that takes values for a location from various databases and calculates the quality 
of life in that city. This value can then be compared to other cities and thus, the optimal location to live can be selected 
by the user. The inception of Habitat was done to enable people to be able to measure how pleasant living in an area would be, 
beyond just their direct household or neighborhood. Furthermore, it would ensure that people who are immigrating to Canada reside
in an area with the most opportunities and pleasant living experience.
